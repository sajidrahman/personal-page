Hi, My name is Sajidur Rahman, friends and acquaintances call me _'Sajid'_ (pronounced as 'SA-ZID'). I am a PhD Student and I am working in
__Institute for Cybersecurity Research Center at University of Florida__ as a graduate research assistant. My research work intersects the following cross-cutting areas:
<!--- Usable Security & Privacy Design - Human-Computer Interaction -->

*  Usable Security & Privacy
*  Social Computing
*  Empirical Software Engineering

Before moving to [UF](http://virtualtour.ufl.edu/), I was pursuing Masters in [Computer Science at Kansas State University](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/) under supervision of [Prof. Eugene Vasserman](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~eyv/).
My MS project was on text mining on Stack Overflow dataset to explore the challenges of software developers utilizing *security-related features* while programming. Here's a link to [my thesis](http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/34563). Before I started my Masters, I worked as Software Engineer for 3.5+ years. During this period, I was involved in various software development projects: from developing centralized MIS system for a large bank to architecting and implementing a core payment engine for a startup fintech company, [SureCash](http://surecash.net/), which has now become [one of the largest mobile payment processors in Bangladesh](https://futurestartup.com/2017/02/11/surecash-101-how-surecash-is-planning-to-become-the-leading-mobile-payment-platform-in-bangladesh/). I completed my BS in Computer Science from [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/), one of the top engineering school in the country.
